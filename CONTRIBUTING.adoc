## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem may already exist and has been
resolved, or the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Having a
reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back and forth with you requiring
additional information, such as:

- the output of `java -version`, `mvn -version`
- `pom.xml` or `.flattened-pom.xml` (when applicable)
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are
fixing the right problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduction in order to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more
bugs. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger codebase, but we
really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

You can file new issues by filling out our https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/solr-osgi/issues/new/choose[issue form].
